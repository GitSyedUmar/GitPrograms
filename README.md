- Hi, I’m @GitSyedUmar
- I’m interested in Data Science.
- I’ve learnt basics of Android Studio.
- I'm moderately proficient in Java Programming Language.

- Open "Own Sample Programs" Folder where I have tried to code certain program logic on my own which might not be efficient but worth your own practice.
